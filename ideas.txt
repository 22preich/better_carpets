TODO:
- purple carpets

- different tp points for different dimensions OR NOT AT ALL

- lime/orange carpets should block a 3rd participant from joining in on the trade of items
- 2 on orange -> 1 on lime
    - might need to split up the one line command in `main`

- ask linc/mult how someone is currently added to central


IDEAS/IMPROVEMENTS:
- if `pvp` team is implemented then red/action needs to be updated
- instead of saying "Teleporting to: *spawn*" maybe just say "*spawn*"?



COMPLETED:
- fix 2 not being able to be on a carpet at the same time
- red/green should say "waiting for player ON RED" and "waiting for player ON GREEN"
- header comments in EVERY file CODE TOO
- generate_carpets.py should delete folders first then generate them
- fix template files coming up in the server log
- red/action needs all team colours
- should be able to continue recieving players even after one has already been recieved
- test leaving red/green carpets early
- if someone is already on a red carpet prevent anyone else from entering one
- put countdown stuff into its own folder
- tags for colour/subtitle, colour/entering, colour/leaving
- red/green carpets should have a cooldowns
- opted for `registriies` instead of tags so we have less conditions and fuctions overall
    - no need for each carpet's 'entry' function
- script for generating home AND white, yellow and blue mcfunctions
    - template needs comments and header


PERMISSIONS:
- bc_CENTRAL to use white carpet
- bc_HOME_BLUE to use a blue carpet as home


FEATURES:
- when you warp with a red carpet you have a cooldown so you can't warp back or accidentally step on other carpets
- doesn't constantly check for carpets around you, only under you and only once
- VISUAL
- SECURE
- SIMPLICITY
    - to configure in game
        - simple commands, simple tags
